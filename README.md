# Symmetric Cryptography

This project focuses on practicing symmetric cryptography techniques. It involves creating an encrypter and decrypter program based on symmetric key algorithms.

## Description

Symmetric cryptography, also known as secret key cryptography, is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using a shared secret key. The objective of this project is to create an encrypter and decrypter program that utilize symmetric key algorithms.

## Execution

To practice symmetric cryptography techniques using the encrypter and decrypter programs, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary programming environment (e.g., Python).
2. Run the encrypter program and provide the plaintext message and the secret key as arguments.
3. The encrypter will generate the encrypted ciphertext using a symmetric key algorithm.
4. To decrypt the ciphertext, run the decrypter program and provide the encrypted message and the secret key as arguments.
5. The decrypter will use the same symmetric key algorithm to revert the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.

## Learning Objectives

This project can help you achieve the following learning objectives:

- Gain hands-on experience with symmetric cryptography techniques.
- Understand the concept of symmetric key algorithms and their role in encrypting and decrypting data.
- Learn how to implement a basic encrypter and decrypter program using symmetric key algorithms.
- Practice using shared secret keys to encrypt and decrypt messages.
- Enhance your understanding of symmetric cryptography principles and their practical applications.

By actively engaging with the encrypter and decrypter programs, you can strengthen your skills in symmetric cryptography, explore different symmetric key algorithms, and deepen your understanding of cryptographic techniques.
