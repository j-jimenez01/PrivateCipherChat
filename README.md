# Symmetric_Cryptography
Practicing with cryptanalysis of substitution ciphers
Creating a simple-substitution encrypter that will take in two arguments: an existing plain-text phrase and a key in the form of the modified alphabet. The second will be a decrypter for the same type of crypto and take in the encrypted phrase and the modified alphabet "key" as arguments.
