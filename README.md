# Private Cipher Chat

Confidential messaging system created for private communication among close friends. It enables secure, real time text conversations, utilizing symmetric encryption for message privacy. This project focuses on practicing symmetric cryptography techniques. It involves creating an encrypter and decrypter program based on symmetric key algorithms. 

## Description

Symmetric cryptography, also known as secret key cryptography, is a method of encrypting and decrypting data using a shared secret key. The objective of this project is to create an encrypter and decrypter program that utilize symmetric key algorithms. Confidential messaging system created for private communication among close
friends. It enables secure, real time text conversations, utilizing symmetric encryption for message privacy.

## Execution

To practice symmetric cryptography techniques using the encrypter and decrypter programs, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary programming environment (e.g., Python).
2. Run the encrypter program and provide the plaintext message and the secret key as arguments.
3. The encrypter will generate the encrypted ciphertext using a symmetric key algorithm.
4. To decrypt the ciphertext, run the decrypter program and provide the encrypted message and the secret key as arguments.
5. The decrypter will use the same symmetric key algorithm to revert the ciphertext back to the original plaintext.
